# Enhanced FIRE Calculation with Inflation & Barista Contribution - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a sophisticated FIRE calculation system that addresses your specific requirements:

1. **Inflation-adjusted retirement targets** - Accounts for purchasing power erosion over time
2. **Barista annual contribution model** - Uses investment capacity during part-time work instead of income
3. **More accurate Barista FIRE calculations** - Two-phase approach with realistic transition modeling

## Key Improvements

### 1. Inflation-Adjusted FIRE Targets

**Before (Simple):**
```
Traditional FIRE = Annual Expenses Ã· Safe Withdrawal Rate
Example: NT$600,000 Ã· 4% = NT$15,000,000
```

**After (Inflation-Adjusted):**
```
Future Annual Expenses = Annual Expenses Ã— (1 + inflation)^years_to_retirement
Traditional FIRE = Future Annual Expenses Ã· Safe Withdrawal Rate

Example with 2.5% inflation over 25 years:
Future Expenses = NT$600,000 Ã— (1.025)^25 = NT$1,097,000
Traditional FIRE = NT$1,097,000 Ã· 4% = NT$27,425,000
```

### 2. Barista Contribution Model

**Before (Confusing):**
- Used `baristaAnnualIncome` (part-time income)
- Required complex post-processing to derive investment capacity
- Unclear user input expectations

**After (Intuitive):**
- Uses `baristaAnnualContribution` (investment capacity during part-time)
- Direct user input: "How much can you invest annually while working part-time?"
- Clear separation between income and investment capacity

### 3. Sophisticated Barista FIRE Calculation

**Before (Oversimplified):**
```
Barista FIRE = (Annual Expenses - Part-time Income) Ã· Safe Withdrawal Rate
```

**After (Two-Phase Simulation):**
```
Phase 1: Full-time work until transition point
Phase 2: Part-time work with reduced contributions until Traditional FIRE

Barista Transition Target = Amount where:
- Portfolio withdrawal (4%) + Barista contributions can sustain growth to Traditional FIRE
- Accounts for reduced contribution capacity during part-time phase
- Uses sophisticated simulation to find optimal transition point
```

## Mathematical Formulas

### Enhanced FIRE Calculations

```python
# 1. Inflation-Adjusted Traditional FIRE
future_annual_expenses = annual_expenses * ((1 + inflation_rate) ** years_to_retirement)
traditional_fire_target = future_annual_expenses / safe_withdrawal_rate

# 2. Coast FIRE (Present Value)
coast_fire_target = traditional_fire_target / ((1 + expected_return) ** years_to_retirement)

# 3. Barista FIRE (Two-Phase Simulation)
def calculate_barista_fire_target(traditional_target, barista_contribution, return_rate, years_to_retirement):
    # Try different transition points (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% of Traditional FIRE)
    for transition_percentage in [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]:
        transition_target = traditional_target * transition_percentage
        
        # Phase 2: Can this transition point reach Traditional FIRE with barista contributions?
        years_in_barista_phase = years_to_retirement * 0.7  # 70% of time in barista phase
        future_value = calculate_compound_growth(transition_target, barista_contribution, years_in_barista_phase)
        
        if future_value >= traditional_target * 0.95:  # 95% threshold for safety
            return transition_target
    
    return traditional_target * 0.5  # Fallback: 50% of Traditional FIRE
```

## Database Schema Updates

### New Fields Added to `fire_profile` Table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE fire_profile ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS barista_annual_contribution DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE fire_profile ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS inflation_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.025;
```

### Enhanced Profile Structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fire_profile (
    -- Existing fields
    profile_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    annual_expenses DECIMAL(15,2),
    safe_withdrawal_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.04,
    expected_annual_return DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.07,
    target_retirement_age INTEGER,
    
    -- Enhanced fields
    barista_annual_contribution DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,  -- NEW: Investment capacity during part-time
    inflation_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.025,           -- NEW: User-specific inflation assumption
    
    -- Comprehensive planning fields
    annual_income DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,
    annual_savings DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,
    expected_return_pre_retirement DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.07,
    expected_return_post_retirement DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.05,
    expected_inflation_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.025,
    other_passive_income DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,
    effective_tax_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.15,
    
    -- Legacy compatibility
    barista_annual_income DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Frontend Enhancements

### Updated FIRE Profile Dialog

**Before:**
```typescript
<TextField
  label="Barista FIRE Monthly Income"
  value={formData.barista_annual_income / 12}
  helperText="Expected monthly income from part-time work"
/>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<TextField
  label="Barista FIRE Annual Contribution"
  value={formData.barista_annual_contribution}
  helperText="How much can you invest annually while working part-time?"
/>

<TextField
  label="Inflation Rate"
  value={(formData.inflation_rate * 100).toFixed(1)}
  helperText="Expected annual inflation rate (2-4% typical)"
  InputProps={{ endAdornment: <Typography>%</Typography> }}
/>
```

### Calculation Results:

**Traditional FIRE:**
- Today's Target: NT$15,000,000 (NT$600,000 Ã· 4%)
- Inflation-Adjusted Target: NT$27,425,000 (accounts for 25 years of 2.5% inflation)
- Inflation Impact: NT$12,425,000 additional needed

**Barista FIRE:**
- Transition Target: NT$8,000,000 (sophisticated two-phase calculation)
- Strategy: Work full-time until NT$8M, then part-time with NT$100K/year investments
- Timeline: Reach Traditional FIRE through reduced but sustained contributions
