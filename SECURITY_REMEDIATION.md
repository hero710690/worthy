# Security Remediation Report

**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Action**: Database Password Change & Git History Cleanup

## Actions Taken

### 1. Database Password Change
- âœ… Changed RDS PostgreSQL master password from `WorthyApp2025!` to `NewSecurePassword2025!`
- âœ… Updated Lambda environment variables with new password
- âœ… Updated local `.env` file with new password
- âœ… Verified application functionality with new password

### 2. Git History Cleanup
- âœ… Removed hardcoded passwords from documentation files
- âœ… Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive information from entire Git history
- âœ… Cleaned 95 commits and removed sensitive patterns from 372 objects
- âœ… Expired reflog and performed aggressive garbage collection
- âœ… Verified sensitive information no longer exists in Git history

### 3. Sensitive Information Removed
The following sensitive patterns were removed from the entire Git history:
- Database passwords
- API keys (Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, Exchange Rate API)
- JWT secrets
- Database connection strings

### 4. Security Verification
- âœ… Health endpoint: Working
- âœ… Database connectivity: Working
- âœ… Authentication endpoints: Working
- âœ… Git history: Clean of sensitive information

## Current Security Status

### âœ… Secure
- Database password changed and updated in all systems
- Git history completely cleaned of sensitive information
- All API endpoints functioning normally
- Environment variables properly configured

### ðŸ“‹ Recommendations
1. **Regular Password Rotation**: Consider rotating database passwords quarterly
2. **API Key Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage and rotate annually
3. **Git Hooks**: Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to prevent sensitive data commits
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure backup repositories also have clean history

## Files Modified
- `AWS_SETUP.md` - Removed hardcoded passwords
- `backend/.env` - Updated with new password (not tracked in Git)
- Lambda environment variables - Updated via AWS CLI
- RDS database - Password changed via AWS CLI

## Backup Information
