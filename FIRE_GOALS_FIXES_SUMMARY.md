# FIRE Goals Issues - Complete Fix Summary

**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**Deployment**: 🌐 **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**

## 🎯 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Coast FIRE Missing from What-If Simulator and Income Breakdown**
**Problem**: Coast FIRE was only showing in the main Dashboard tab, but missing from the What-If Simulator and Income Breakdown tabs.

**Root Cause**: The calculation logic in these tabs only included Traditional and Barista FIRE calculations.

**✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

#### **What-If Simulator Tab**:
- **Added Coast FIRE calculations**: Implemented Coast FIRE target calculation using present value formula
- **Added Coast FIRE results display**: New Coast FIRE results card with achievement tracking
- **Enhanced insights**: Added Coast FIRE comparison in Key Insights section
- **Real-time updates**: Coast FIRE now updates live with parameter changes

```typescript
// Added Coast FIRE target calculation
const yearsToRetirement = Math.max(targetRetirementAge - currentAge, 0);
const coastFireTarget = yearsToRetirement > 0 ? 
  traditionalFireTarget / Math.pow(1 + expectedReturn, yearsToRetirement) : 
  traditionalFireTarget;
const yearsToCoast = calculateYearsToTarget(coastFireTarget);
```

#### **Income Breakdown Tab**:
- **Changed layout**: Modified from 2-column (md={6}) to 3-column (md={4}) layout
- **Added Coast FIRE income card**: Complete Coast FIRE income breakdown with visual elements
- **Updated Income Strategy Comparison**: Replaced "Difference" section with Coast FIRE comparison
- **Enhanced Key Insights**: Added Coast FIRE benefits and portfolio requirements

```typescript
// Added Coast FIRE income data
coast: {
  investmentIncome: coastInvestmentIncome,
  totalIncome: coastInvestmentIncome,
  coastAmount: coastCalc.target_amount,
  breakdown: [
    { source: 'Investment Returns', amount: coastInvestmentIncome, percentage: 100 }
  ]
}
```

### **Issue 2: Expected Annual Return Wrong Format**
**Problem**: Expected Annual Return was displaying as "0.07%" instead of "7%" in the Current Portfolio Status section.

**Root Cause**: The value was being displayed as a raw decimal (0.07) instead of being converted to percentage format.

**✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
{fireProfile?.expected_annual_return || 7}%

// AFTER (correct)
{((fireProfile?.expected_annual_return || 0.07) * 100).toFixed(0)}%
```

**Result**: Now correctly displays "7%" instead of "0.07%"

---

### **Issue 3: Goals Achieved Count Incorrect**
**Problem**: Goals Achieved was showing "1" but no FIRE cards were displaying as achieved.

**Root Cause**: The Goals Achieved count was using a manual calculation comparing portfolio value to target amounts, while the FIRE cards were using the backend's `achieved` status.

**✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect logic)
{calculations.filter(c => (portfolioValuation?.totalValueInBaseCurrency || 0) >= c.target_amount).length}

// AFTER (correct logic)
{calculations.filter(c => c.achieved).length}
```

**Result**: Goals Achieved count now correctly shows "0" when no goals are achieved, matching the card displays.
